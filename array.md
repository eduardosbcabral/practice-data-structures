Array
  - contiguous area of memory consisting of equal-size elements indexed by contiguous integers.

What's special about arrays?
  - constant-time access to read any element - O(1)
  - constant-time to add/remove at the end
  - linear time do add/remove at an arbitrary location
  - (array_addr + elem_size x (i - first_index))

Multi-Dimensional Arrays
  - Order or Indexing:
    - Row Major, Column Major
